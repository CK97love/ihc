TLDR: Hit me up if you have Javascript experience (especially React or ExpressJS) to
help make an impact on people's health!

Hi everyone!
I'm volunteering with the International Health Collective, an organization that,
among other things, hosts monthly medical clinics in Mexico for low-resource
populations, and my project is
to create a specialized EMR (electronic medical record) system for them. If you
want to have an impact on people's health and lives, especially if you have some
experience with React/React Native or ExpressJS, then please message me!
